Functionalities:   
A python program written to interact with the GDAX exchange. 

This will run server side in the background and will not have a ui. It will probably have a log of some kind. It will listen for incoming trade data and use it to predict the value 24hrs from now. I have already set up a live websocket feed that is recording this data for my Econ thesis. If I have time I would like to implement a way to use the predictions to make market operations using the GDAX api. Market operations will be made using an algorithmic trader hooked up to a wallet. If we have time, manual market operations will be possible in the online GUI through exchanges with provided information.
Live websocket feed for reading/recording ✔️(done)  
Machine learning analysis (basic)  
Interaction with the feed, market operations (basic)  
Create web based general user interface that shows market changes and predictions (basic) and makes trades (stretch)  
Port stock Technical Indicators, moving averages, and pivot points (stretch)  
Use multiple time intervals to predict short, medium, and long term changes (stretch)  
Machine learning algorithm.  
This is the meat and potatoes of the project. A Hidden Markov Model, Random Forest, and a General Linear Model will be used to for predictions
General Linear Model (Basic) ✔️(mostly done)  
Hidden Markov Model (Basic)  
Greater than 50% accuracy (basic)  
Random Forest (stretch)  
Greater than 80% accuracy (stretch)  
Test multiple time intervals (stretch)  
Greater than 90% accuracy (stretch stretch)
